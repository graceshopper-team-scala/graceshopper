# Grace Hopper Motors ![]()

## Introduction


<em>Grace Hopper Motors</em> is an e-commerce web application for a fictitious car dealership. Built using React, Redux, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL.

## Checkout the App

[Deployed to Heroku](http://grace-hopper-motors.herokuapp.com/)


## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. `npm install`.
3. Create `graceshopper` database.
4. Start the build process and your application with: `npm run start:dev`. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute npm run start-server and npm run build:watch separately (in their own terminal tabs).
5. Navigate to `localhost:8080` to see the site in the browser.
6. Check out the starting seed file in `seed.js` - you can run it by executing `npm run seed`. You will need to seed the database once you've set up the Sequelize models.
